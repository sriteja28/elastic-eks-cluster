# My Infrastructure Project

This project is designed following best practices as recommended by HashiCorp for developing Terraform modules and organizing infrastructure as code. The primary goal of this project is to create a reusable, maintainable, and scalable infrastructure setup that leverages Terraform workspaces to manage different environments (dev, stage, prod) effectively.

## Overview

### Key Features:
- **Best Practices**: The project structure follows the guidelines outlined by HashiCorp for [module composition](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop/composition), ensuring a clean and modular approach to infrastructure management.
- **Workspace Management**: Terraform workspaces are used to manage environment-specific configurations (dev, stage, prod) with minimal code duplication, reducing the risk of errors and simplifying the management of multiple environments.
- **Modular Design**: The infrastructure is broken down into reusable modules that encapsulate specific functionalities, such as networking, compute, data, and application layers. This modular approach allows for easy scaling and maintenance.
- **Remote State Backend**: The project uses a remote state backend (S3 with DynamoDB for locking) to store Terraform state files securely. This ensures that the state is centralized, secure, and accessible across different environments and team members, preventing state conflicts and ensuring consistency.
